# writ

Environment manager with platform-aware symlinks

## Usage

```
writ [flags]
```

## Description

Writ orchestrates your portable environment—configuration, scripts, utilities,
templates, and software manifests. Lore is a component that writ delegates to
for software installation.

One command deploys your environment. Platform-aware projects adapt
automatically. Templates handle machine-specific values.

Writ exists because environment management shouldn't require manual symlink
creation, platform-specific scripts, or secret leakage into git.
Declare your environment once — writ deploys it everywhere you work.

| `--dry-run` | `false` | Show what would be done without making changes |
| `--filter` | `[]` | Filter expression: field=value (repeatable, AND logic) |
| `--interactive` | `false` | Force interactive mode (prompts, rich output) |

| `--output, -o` | `json` | Output rendering. json is the default and the native format; every other rendering presents that JSON rather than the Go value behind it. Reach for yaml to read a large result, table or list to scan one, csv or value to feed another program, template when you need a shape none of these produce, and none when you want the exit code and the side effects alone.<br><br>The renderings, alphabetically, each closing with what it is for:<br>csv            quoted and parseable; when a spreadsheet or a data tool reads it<br>json           the native format, nothing elided; when a script consumes it<br>list           one field per line; when a record is wide, or records differ<br>none           nothing at all; when you want the exit code, not the output<br>table          aligned columns, one row per record; when scanning many rows<br>template=BODY  a Go template; when you need a shape none of the others give<br>value          raw, tab-separated, no header; when cut or awk consumes it<br>yaml           the same content as json; when reading a large result by eye |
