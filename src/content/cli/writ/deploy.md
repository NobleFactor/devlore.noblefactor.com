# writ deploy

Deploy projects by creating symlinks in the target location

## Usage

```
writ deploy [flags] <project>...
```

## Description

Deploy projects by creating symlinks in the target location.

Files inside each project directory are symlinked to the target (default: ~).
Platform-specific variants (e.g., project.Darwin) are selected automatically.
If a project contains packages-manifest.yaml, the manifest is resolved through
the lore Planner, adding package installation nodes to the execution graph.

Conflict handling (--conflict) — occupied targets (phase-8 step 49):
  stop     (default) Refuse foreign or locally-modified occupants, listing them;
           writ's own unmodified outputs are recognized and replaced, so
           redeploys flow without the flag
  skip     Leave every occupied target untouched and continue
  replace  Archive each occupant to the recovery site and overwrite (restorable)
