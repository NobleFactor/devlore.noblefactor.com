# writ upgrade

Regenerate copied files (templates, secrets) from current sources

## Usage

```
writ upgrade [<project>...] [flags]
```

## Description

Regenerate copied files (templates, secrets) from current sources.

Symlinks are not affected. Only files that were copied during deployment
(templates expanded, secrets decrypted) are regenerated.

The copied inventory comes from the store readback; source templates/secrets are
re-processed through the same planned chains deploy uses.

Each copied file is classified first: a missing target regenerates freely; an
up-to-date target is left alone; a differing target skips with a warning and
regenerates only under --force — until recorded content identity lands (step 48),
source-changed cannot be distinguished from target-modified. Encrypted (sops)
entries cannot be compared without decrypting and follow the same --force rule.

## Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--force` | `false` | Overwrite locally modified files without prompting |

| `--dry-run` | `false` | Show what would be done without making changes |
| `--filter` | `[]` | Filter expression: field=value (repeatable, AND logic) |
| `--interactive` | `false` | Force interactive mode (prompts, rich output) |

| `--output, -o` | `json` | Output rendering. json is the default and the native format; every other rendering presents that JSON rather than the Go value behind it. Reach for yaml to read a large result, table or list to scan one, csv or value to feed another program, template when you need a shape none of these produce, and none when you want the exit code and the side effects alone.<br><br>The renderings, alphabetically, each closing with what it is for:<br>csv            quoted and parseable; when a spreadsheet or a data tool reads it<br>json           the native format, nothing elided; when a script consumes it<br>list           one field per line; when a record is wide, or records differ<br>none           nothing at all; when you want the exit code, not the output<br>table          aligned columns, one row per record; when scanning many rows<br>template=BODY  a Go template; when you need a shape none of the others give<br>value          raw, tab-separated, no header; when cut or awk consumes it<br>yaml           the same content as json; when reading a large result by eye |
